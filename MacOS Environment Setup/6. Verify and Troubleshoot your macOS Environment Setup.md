1. Open your "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `curl -so- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-co-curriculum/flatiron-manual-setup-validator/master/mac-os-phase-0-validation-script.sh | zsh 2> /dev/null`

## Check Your Work

If all checks pass, you have completed your environment setup and are ready to move on!

If something does not pass, that is okay. Revisit the installation instructions for the item that did not pass. If you are able to run the commands listed in the **Check Your Work** section for that item, this may just be an issue with the validator.

## Troubleshooting

### Fixing NVM and RVM Dotfile Issues for MacOS

If you are having trouble getting RVM, Ruby, NVM, or Node to work, you may have an issue with your `.zshrc` file. To fix, we need to run two commands.

The first command makes a backup of your current `.zshrc` file:

```
$mv ~/.zshrc{,.bak}
```

The second command replaces the contents of your `.zshrc` file with a default dot file:

```
$curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/master/.zshrc > ~/.zshrc
```

Close and reopen your terminal. With a new `.zshrc` file, we can now test out each tool.

### Verify RVM is Installed

To confirm that RVM is working, run:

```
$rvm
```

If you see a long message ending in `"For additional documentation please visit https://rvm.io"`, RVM is installed.

> If the command `rvm` is not recognized, do the following in your terminal:
>
> 1. Type `brew install gmp` and press `<Enter>`
> 2. Type `brew install gnupg` and press `<Enter>`
> 3. Type `curl -sSL https://rvm.io/mpapis.asc | gpg --import -` and press `<Enter>`
> 4. Type `curl -sSL https://rvm.io/pkuczynski.asc | gpg --import -` and press `<Enter>`
> 5. Type `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash` and press `<Enter>`
> 6. Close the "Terminal" application
> 7. Reopen the "Terminal" application

### Verify Ruby is Installed

To confirm Ruby is installed, run:

```
$rvm list
```

If you see `=* ruby-2.7.4`, Ruby is installed and 2.7.4 set as the default version and you are all set for Ruby.

> If you do not see `ruby-2.7.4` at all, install it with the following command:
>
> ```
> $rvm install ruby-2.7.4
> ```
>
> If `ruby-2.7.4` is listed, but is not preceded by `=*`, make it the default version by running:
>
> ```
> $rvm use 2.7.4 --default
> ```

### Verify NVM is installed

To confirm NVM is installed, run:

```
$nvm
```

If you see a message ending with `"Note: to remove, delete, or uninstall nvmâ€¦"`, NVM is installed.

> If the `nvm` command is not recognized or you see an error `complete:13: command not found: compdef`, run the following command:
>
> ```
> $curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
> ```

### Verify Node is Installed

To confirm Node is installed, run:

```
$nvm list
```

If you see a message starting with "-> v14.13.0" (or any number higher than this), a version of Node is installed that will work for this course.

> If you don't see this number, install the newest version of Node:
>
> ```
> $nvm install node
> ```
