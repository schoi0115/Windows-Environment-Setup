# MacOS System Setup

[![GitHub Repo]( &#34;Open GitHub Repo&#34;)](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-macos-env-system)[![Create New Issue]( &#34;Create New Issue&#34;)](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-macos-env-system/issues/new/choose)The following instructions are for macOS Catalina through BigSur. If you are not on Catalina or a later operating system like BigSur but have the option to update, we recommend doing so before following the instructions below.

**Note** : Throughout the environment setup, you will see commands that look like this:

```
$whoami
```

Any time you see a command like this with a `$` at the beginning, those commands should be entered in your terminal **without** the `$`. So for the example above, you would type `whoami` in the terminal (without a `$`).

## Check That Your macOS System is Compatible with Flatiron School’s Requirements

When working on software, it is important that your computer and the software you’re using are compatible. In this step, we’ll ensure that you can install all the tools you will need to complete the program.

### Action Item

1. Click on the Apple () menu in the top left of the window
2. Choose "About This Mac" from the menu
3. Look for the version name (for example, "macOS Big Sur")
4. Look for the version number (for example, "Version 11.4")

### Check Your Work

If your version name is macOS Catalina or Big Sur and your version number is greater than "Version 10.15.0", your computer meets our requirements for the course and you can continue below.

If your computer does not meet the requirements listed above, but you can upgrade, we recommend that you upgrade after completing the environment setup.

If your computer does not meet the requirements and you can't upgrade, some programs may not work for you. Please reach out to an instructor for more information.

## Check that Your macOS System Has Enough Space for Flatiron School’s Requirements

The programs that we’ll be installing during environment setup and all of the work you’ll do with Flatiron School will need at least 4 GB of free disk space. Follow the steps below to ensure that you have enough disk space to install all the programs needed during environment setup.

### Action Item

1. Click on the Apple () menu in the top left of the window
2. Choose "About This Mac" from the menu
3. Click the "Storage" tab header
4. Look for your macOS partition (for example, "Macintosh HD")
5. Look for the storage (for example, "119.59 GB available of 186 GB")

### Check Your Work


If your free space for your macOS partition is greater than 4 GB, continue below. Otherwise, click "Manage..." to open the System Information window and free up some storage space.

## ALERT - For New M1 Mac Laptops ONLY

If you are using a Mac laptop with the new **M1** chip (released in late 2020), there are some additional steps required at this stage to ensure all necessary tools install correctly. Follow the steps below instead of the normal instructions provided for installing Xcode, Homebrew and Ruby.

**1.** Instead of installing Xcode via the directions in the next section, open your terminal and run the following to install Xcode:

```
$xcode-select --install
```

**2.** Create a duplicate copy of the terminal app that can run x86 programs with Rosetta. Follow the steps [detailed in this article** (Links to an external site.)**](https://www.notion.so/Run-x86-Apps-including-homebrew-in-the-Terminal-on-Apple-Silicon-8350b43d97de4ce690f283277e958602) ([https://www.notion.so/Run-x86-Apps-including-homebrew-in-the-Terminal-on-Apple-Silicon-8350b43d97de4ce690f283277e958602** (Links to an external site.)**](https://www.notion.so/Run-x86-Apps-including-homebrew-in-the-Terminal-on-Apple-Silicon-8350b43d97de4ce690f283277e958602)) to do this.

**Note: Every installation step should now be done in the terminal window that has Rosetta enabled**

**3.** Install Homebrew with the following command:

```
$arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

**4.** Run the following three commands one after the other to install RVM and Ruby:

```
$curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
$source $HOME/.rvm/scripts/rvm
$rvm install 2.7.4
```

**In addition, if you are using an M1 laptop, you will already have Zsh installed and in use, so you can move on to installing Chrome and VS Code below.**

## Install Command Line Tools for Xcode

Command Line Tools for Xcode is a suite of development tools from Apple, including tools for building Mac and iPhone applications. It will help you to quickly set up your environment by downloading and installing essential tools for other programs we'll be installing.

### Action Item

1. Open the [Apple Developer Download webpage** (Links to an external site.)**](https://developer.apple.com/download/all) ([https://developer.apple.com/download/all** (Links to an external site.)**](https://developer.apple.com/download/all))
2. Look for the most recent version of "Command Line Tools for XCode ( **Note** : Make sure to look for "Command Line Tools" in the name, as there is also a separate "XCode" package. You want the "Command Line Tools for XCode"). At the time of writing, the most recent version is "Command Line Tools for Xcode 12.5".
3. Click "View Details" to see more information about the download
4. Click "Command Line Tools for XCode 12.5.dmg" to download
5. When the download is finished, click on the file to install

### Check Your Work


Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search", at the terminal prompt type `xcode-select --install` and press `<Enter>`. If your terminal says "xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed...", continue below.

## Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. It allows us to quickly install a number of programs we will need.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"` and press `<Enter>`
3. Follow the prompts on the screen during the installation (Note: this could take a while.)
4. Close the "Terminal" application
5. Reopen the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"

### Check Your Work


You can verify that Homebrew is successfully installed by running `brew help`. If your terminal outputs a list of `brew` commands, you're all set.

## Check Whether You Need to Install Zsh

Zsh is the new standard shell for the macOS and comes pre-installed with the latest version of macOS, but it may need to be installed on older Macs.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `echo $SHELL` and press `<Enter>`
3. **If you see `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/local/bin/zsh` DO NOT continue with the next steps. Move on to "Check Your Work".**

Otherwise, to install Zsh:

1. Type `brew install zsh` and press `<Enter>`
2. Type `echo /usr/local/bin/zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells` and press `<Enter>` (Note: you will need to enter your password.)
3. Type `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh` and press `<Enter>`
4. Close the "Terminal" application
5. Reopen the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
6. If you receive a message starting with "This is the Z Shell configuration function for new users, zsh-newuser-install", press `0`.

### Check Your Work


If you run `echo $SHELL`, the terminal should output `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/local/bin/zsh`. This indicates that Zsh is in use and you are set to continue below.

## Troubleshooting

If you see the following message when opening your terminal:

```
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?
```

Type `y` and press enter, then run the following command:

```
$compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

Close and reopen your terminal to clear the error.

## Install Google Chrome

Google Chrome is the browser that we will use for your Flatiron School Student Portal account and also for front-end web development. You are not required to use Google Chrome for personal work, but we highly encourage you to download it for access to your account and for development in the browser.

### Check Your Work


If you can open the "Google Chrome" application using "Spotlight Search", continue below.

## Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is the tool that you’ll use to edit your Ruby and JavaScript files. It is a text editor that provides some beneficial extensions for developers. One such tool is an integrated terminal! This means that you can edit your code and use your terminal in the same window. Follow the steps below to get both set up.

### Action Item
