# Mac Git And Github Configuration

[![GitHub Repo]( &#34;Open GitHub Repo&#34;)](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-macos-env-git-github)[![Create New Issue]( &#34;Create New Issue&#34;)](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-macos-env-git-github/issues/new/choose)## Install `git`

Git generally comes pre-installed with most operating systems, but you can check by running `git version` in the terminal. If this gives you an error or does not come back with a version number, you'll need to install Git. You can install it using Homebrew.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `brew install git` and press `<Enter>`
3. Close the "Terminal" application
4. Reopen the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
5. Type `git version` and press `<Enter>`

### Check Your Work


If you see a message starting with "git version...", continue below.

## Create a GitHub Account

To work on and get credit for the labs and lessons that you work on during the program, you will need to sign up for a GitHub account  *if you don’t already have one* .

### Action Item


1. Open the [GitHub signup webpage** (Links to an external site.)**](https://github.com/join) ([https://github.com/join** (Links to an external site.)**](https://github.com/join))
2. Fill out the form and create your account
3. Verify the email address connected to your GitHub account

### Check Your Work

If you were able to verify your email address, continue below.

## Configure Git and GitHub

Git is the tool that we’ll use to download and upload the work that we do in labs and lessons. To use Git without signing in every time, you can create a Secure Shell (SSH) key and associate that to your GitHub account. Lastly, you will want to run a few commands to make sure that when you use Git, you get the proper credit for your work. This step will ask you to do work both in your browser and your terminal.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `git config --global color.ui true` and press `<Enter>`
3. Type `git config --global user.name` + `<Space>` + your name and press `<Enter>` *(Note: this should be your full name, not your GitHub username, in quotes.)*
4. Type `git config --global user.email` + `<Space>` + the email address you used to sign up to GitHub and press `<Enter>`
5. Type `git config --global init.defaultBranch main` to [update the default branch name** (Links to an external site.)**](https://github.com/github/renaming) to `main`
6. Type `ssh-keygen` and press `<Enter>`
7. For each prompt  **do not type anything** , just continue to press `<Enter>`. It's particularly important that you **do not enter a passphase** and leave the passphrase empty when prompted; otherwise, you'll have to enter that passphrase any time you interact with GitHub (which will happen a lot during the program); and you may run into issues submitting assignments later.
8. Type `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy` and press `<Enter>`. This will copy your SSH key to your clipboard
9. Open the [GitHub New SSH key form** (Links to an external site.)**](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new) ([https://github.com/settings/ssh/new** (Links to an external site.)**](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new)) *(Note: you need to be logged in to GitHub to access that link.)*
10. Type "My personal Mac" in the "Title" input field
11. Paste what’s on your clipboard from step 8 in the "Key" input field
12. Click "Add SSH Key"
