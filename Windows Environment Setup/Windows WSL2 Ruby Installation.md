# Windows WSL2 Ruby Installation

[![GitHub Repo]( &#34;Open GitHub Repo&#34;)](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-wsl2-env-ruby)[![Create New Issue]( &#34;Create New Issue&#34;)](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-0-wsl2-env-ruby/issues/new/choose)## Install Ruby Environment Manager (RVM) on Ubuntu

Ruby Environment Manager (RVM) is a tool that will allow you to download and install multiple versions of Ruby, one of the programming languages that we teach at Flatiron School. Installing RVM is the first step in installing Ruby on your Ubuntu operating system.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
2. Type `sudo apt-get install software-properties-common` and press `<Enter>`
3. You may be asked to enter your Ubuntu terminal password
4. Type `sudo -E apt-add-repository -y ppa:rael-gc/rvm` and press `<Enter>`
5. Type `sudo apt-get update` and press `<Enter>`
6. Type `sudo apt-get install rvm` and press `<Enter>` *(Note: if you are asked "Do you want to continue [Y/n]", type "Y" and press `<Enter>`)*
7. Type `source /etc/profile.d/rvm.sh` and press `<Enter>`
8. Type `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/master/rvm-shell-script >> ~/.bashrc` and press `<Enter>`
9. Close the "Ubuntu" application
10. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
11. Type `rvm` and press `<Enter>`

### Check Your Work

If you see a long message ending in "For additional documentation, please visit [https://rvm.io** (Links to an external site.)**](https://rvm.io/)", continue below. If `rvm` is not found, check out the troubleshooting steps in the **Verify and Troubleshoot your WSL2 Environment Setup** lesson later on in this module.

## Install Ruby Version 2.7.4 on Ubuntu

For our Ruby labs and lessons, we expect that students use Ruby version 2.7.4 on Ubuntu. If Ruby Environment Manager (RVM) has been successfully installed, you can quickly install Ruby with a couple of commands.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
2. If the "Ubuntu" application is still open from the last step, close and re-open to prevent errors with running the next command.
3. Type `rvm install 2.7.4 --default` and press `<Enter>`
4. Enter your Ubuntu password if prompted
5. Type `rvm list` and press `<Enter>`

### Check Your Work

If you see a message starting with `=* ruby-2.7.4`, continue below.

> **Note:** If you see that Ruby 2.7.4 is installed, but does not display `=*` before it, close and reopen the "Ubuntu" application, then run `rvm use 2.7.4 --default`.

## Troubleshooting Ruby Installs

If you encounter issues installing a version of Ruby via RVM, try the following in Ubuntu:

* Run `rvm group add rvm $USER`
* Close Ubuntu and reopen
* Run `rvm fix-permissions`

After running the last command, try installing Ruby again with `rvm install 2.7.4 --default`

If you are continuing to have issues installing RVM, try running the following:

```
$sudo usermod -a -G rvm $USER
```

After running, try installing Ruby again.

## Install Ruby Gems on Ubuntu

Ruby Gems are small programs written in Ruby that help you to code more easily in Ruby. The gems you will install today include: Bundler, which allows you to keep track of which gems your projects need to work, and Pry, which allows you to pause your Ruby code when it runs and inspect it.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
2. Type `gem update --system` and press `<Enter>`
3. Type `gem install bundler` and press `<Enter>`
4. Type `gem install pry` and press `<Enter>`
5. Type `gem list | wc -l` and press `<Enter>`

### Check Your Work

If you are able to complete each step without any issues and you see an output of a number around or above 40 from the last command, continue to the next lesson,  **Configuring Git and GitHub on WSL2** .
