Node Version Manager (NVM) is a tool that will allow you to download and install multiple versions of Node.js, one of the environments for the JavaScript programming language that we teach at Flatiron School. Installing NVM is the first step in installing Node.js on your Ubuntu operating system.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
2. Type `curl -o- curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash` and press `<Enter>`
3. Type `curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flatiron-school/dotfiles/master/nvm-shell-script >> ~/.bashrc` and press `<Enter>`
4. Close the "Ubuntu" application
5. Reopen the "Ubuntu" application
6. Type `nvm` and press `<Enter>`

### Check Your Work

If you see a message ending with "Note: to remove, delete, or uninstall nvm", continue below.

> **Note:** If `nvm` is not recognized, or you are seeing new errors when restarting the "Ubuntu" application, check out the troubleshooting steps in the **Verify and Troubleshoot your WSL2 Environment Setup** lesson later on in this module.

## Install Node.js on Ubuntu

For our JavaScript labs and lessons, we expect that students use Node.js on Ubuntu. If Node Version Manager (NVM) has been successfully installed, you can quickly install Node.js with a couple of commands.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Ubuntu" application using the "Start" menu
2. Type `nvm install node` and press `<Enter>`
3. Type `nvm list` and press `<Enter>`

### Check Your Work

If you see a message starting with "-> v14.13.0" (or any higher number, like "-> v14.13.10" or "-> v15.0.0"), continue to the next lesson,  **Installing Ruby on WSL2** .
